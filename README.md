This repository contains code used to scrape the NBA's game-by-game logs and create a database of referee performance. The resulting dataset contains every foul called by every referee in the 2023-24 NBA season. 

Teams could use this information to strategize and adapt their gameplan based on the refereeing crew for a given game.
